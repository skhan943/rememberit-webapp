## RememberIt

### Background
If you are like me then you like to save everything that you find interesting, want to watch later, don't want to forget, etc. For the longest time, I've been using an empty groupchat to store all my memories. Then I realized this is a problem that I can fix!

That's how the idea for RememberIt was born. I drew up some UI sketches in figma and got to work. After a couple months of working on it on and off on my own time, I can now easily track and search through my memories with a purpose-built system.

### Technologies
RememberIt is a web-app I built with React that allows you to interface with a REST API (express.js backend) and a MongoDB database that stores your memories.
The MongoDB database is stored in a docker container in order to allow for easy deployment and set-up on other devices.
